		<h1>Import Actions</h1>
		<div>
		<h2>Importing Overview</h2>
		<p>There are two major ways to import data into <em>Concerto</em>:
			<ul><li> using exported archives from <em>Concerto</em> itself</li>
			<li>using files handwritten or programatically produced from other data</li></ul>
			Here we will start with the former and more basic: using archives that <em>Concerto</em> has exported for you; if you are interested in programatically populating your own data into <em>Concerto</em> see [[Importing - Advanced Topics]]</p>
		</div>

		<h2><em>Collections</em> - Importing <em>Collection(s)</em></h2>
		<div>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>You can import a <em>Collection</em> that has been exported by <em>Concerto's</em> '<em>Collection</em> Exporter' by selecting the archive that you downloaded from <em>Concerto</em> and uploading it to the importer.  This will create a new <em>Collection</em> that is identical to the one that was exported, including the metadata and the metadata <em>Schemas</em> used in the exported <em>Collection</em>.</p>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>Clicking the 'Import <em>Collection(s)</em>' link when browsing the  <em>Collections</em> in <em>Concerto</em> will send you to a form for importing one or more <em>Collections</em>.</p>
		<p>This form has four inputs:
		<ul><li>a drop down list for indicating the metadata file type</li>
		<li>a checkbox for indicating an archive</li>
		<li>a second drop down box for indicating the import type</li>
		<li>a file upload box for choosing a file to upload</li></ul>
		The first step is to choose the format of the import from the drop down menu.  All archives exported by <em>Concerto</em> use the XML file format for encoding the metadata and structure associated with <em>Concerto</em> data.  The next input is the checkbox; the data exported from <em>Concerto</em> is always in an archive and so you want to check the checkbox.  When importing any archive always make sure the checkbox is checked, otherwise the importer will not decompress the archive and will fail to find the files it needs to perform the import.  The third step is simple, because there is only one option currently implemented, and this is to 'insert' the data from the archive into <em>Concerto</em>.  The final step before starting the import is to choose the archive that you would like to import.  Some browsers offer a text field to type in the location of the desired archive, and most offer a 'Browse...' button that allows you to navigate to the archive.  Once you have your archive selected the last step is to click the 'Import' button.</p>
		<p>Once you have clicked 'Import' the import will begin and you will notice your browser waiting for the page to load; this may take a while depending on the size of the <em>Collection</em> you are importing.  When the import is complete your browser will automatically return you to browsing the <em>Collections</em>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2><em>Assets</em> - Importing <em>Assets</em></h2>
		<div>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>You can import <em>Assets</em> into an already existing <em>Collection</em> by selecting the archive that you downloaded from either <em>Concerto's</em> '<em>Selection</em> Exporter' or '<em>Collection</em> Exporter'  and uploading it to the importer (If you choose to import an archive that was exported as a <em>Collection</em> you will not be changing any <em>Collection's</em> attributes, you will only be adding the archived <em>Collection's Assets</em> into the selected <em>Collection</em>).  This will add to the <em>Collection</em> the <em>Assets</em> that were exported, including their metadata and the metadata <em>Schemas</em> used in the exported <em>Assets</em>.</p>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>Clicking the 'Import <em>Assets</em>' link when browsing a  <em>Collection</em> in <em>Concerto</em> will send you to a form for importing <em>Assets</em> into a <em>Collection</em>.</p>
		<p>This form has four inputs:
		<ul><li>a drop down list for indicating the metadata file type</li>
		<li>a checkbox for indicating an archive</li>
		<li>a second drop down box for indicating the import type</li>
		<li>a file upload box for choosing a file to upload</li></ul>
		The first step is to choose the format of the import from the drop down menu.  All archives exported by <em>Concerto</em> use the XML file format for encoding the metadata and structure associated with <em>Concerto</em> data (the other options of EXIF and Tab-Delimited metadata are explained in [[Importing - Advanced Topics#Importing with non-XML Data]].  The next input is the checkbox; the data exported from <em>Concerto</em> is always in an archive and so you want to check the checkbox.  When importing any archive always make sure the checkbox is checked, otherwise the importer will not decompress the archive and will fail to find the files it needs to perform the import.  The third step is simple, because there is only one option currently implemented, and this is to 'insert' the data from the archive into <em>Concerto</em>.  The final step before starting the import is to choose the archive that you would like to import.  Some browsers offer a text field to type in the location of the desired archive, and most offer a 'Browse...' button that allows you to navigate to the archive.  Once you have your archive selected the last step is to click the 'Import' button.</p>
		<p>Once you have clicked 'Import' the import will begin and you will notice your browser waiting for the page to load; this may take a while depending on the size and number of <em>Assets</em> you are importing.  When the import is complete your browser will automatically return you to browsing the <em>Collection</em> into which you imported.</p>

		<h1>Export Actions</h1>


		<h2><em>Collections</em> - Exporting a Single <em>Collection</em></h2>
		
		<div><h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>You can export an entire <em>Collection</em> out of <em>Concerto</em> into an archive for download containing: all of the <em>Assets</em>, their metadata, and the metadata <em>Schemas</em> used to format the metadata in the <em>Collection</em>.  This archived <em>Collection</em> can then be imported elsewhere (in <em>Concerto</em>) for easy data population.</p>

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>Clicking the 'Export' link on any single <em>Collection</em> will send you to a form for exporting a copy of that <em>Collection</em> out of <em>Concerto</em>.</p>
		<p>This form has two inputs: 
		<ul><li> a text field for giving a name for the archive</li>
		<li> a drop down list for selecting the compression type</li></ul>
		The 'Archive Name' text field is where you enter the name you wish to give the exported and compressed archive of the chosen <em>Collection</em>.  The 'Compression' choices are selectable in a drop down list, and there may only be one available.  Once you have entered an 'Archive Name' and chosen a 'Compression' all that is left is to click the 'Export' button.</p>
		<p>Once you have clicked 'Export' the export will begin, and you will notice your browser waiting for the page to load, this may take a while depending on the size of the <em>Collection</em> you are exporting.  When the export is complete your browser will prompt you to save the archive or open it; some browsers will give you the option to rename the archive, this is optional.  Save the archive to your desired location; this will download the archive.</p>
		<p>Once the download is complete click the 'Cancel' button to go back to browsing the <em>Collections</em>.</p>
		<h3>Export Format</h3>
		<p>The archive that is exported by the '<em>Collection</em> Exporter' is formatted to be imported by the '<em>Collection</em> Importer', accessible while browsing <em>Collections</em> via the 'Import <em>Collection(s)</em>' link, see [[Importing - Basics#Collections - Importing Collection(s)]].  The Import will create a new <em>Collection</em> that is identical to the exported one.</p></div>


		<h2><em>Assets</em> - Using the <em>Selection</em> to Export <em>Assets</em></h2>
		
		<div><h3>Overview</h3>
		<p><em>Assets</em> are not exported directly from their <em>Collections</em>.  In order to export one or more <em>Assets</em> you must first add them to your <em>Selection</em> from their <em>Collection</em>.  You can add any <em>Asset</em> that you have authorization for to the <em>Selection</em>.  The <em>Selection</em> can contain <em>Assets</em> from different <em>Collections</em>, allowing you to export a variety of <em>Assets</em> from different locations into one archive.</p>

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>Once you have all the <em>Assets</em> you want to export in the <em>Selection</em> you can click on the <em>Selection</em> to go to the <em>Selection</em> interface.  There you will find the link for exporting the <em>Assets</em> in the <em>Selection</em>.  Clicking the link will send you to a form for exporting the <em>Selection</em>.</p>
		<p>This form has two inputs: 
		<ul><li> a text field for giving a name for the archive</li>
		<li> a drop down list for selecting the compression type</li></ul>
		The 'Archive Name' text field is where you enter the name you wish to give the exported and compressed archive of the <em>Assets</em> in your <em>Selection</em>.  The 'Compression' choices are selectable in a drop down list, and there may only be one available.  Once you have entered an 'Archive Name' and chosen a 'Compression' all that is left is to click the 'Export' button.</p>
		<p>Once you have clicked 'Export' the export will begin, and you will notice your browser waiting for the page to load.  This may take a while depending on the size and number of <em>Assets</em> in your <em>Selection</em>.  When the export is complete your browser will prompt you to save the archive or open it; some browsers will give you the option to rename the archive, this is optional.  Save the archive to your desired location; this will download the archive.</p>
		<p>Once the download is complete click the 'Cancel' button to go back to browsing your <em>Selection</em>.</p>

		<h3>Export Format</h3>
		<p>The archive that is exported by the <em>Selection</em> is formatted to be imported by the '<em>Asset</em> Importer', accessible while browsing <em>Collections</em> via the 'Import <em>Assets</em>' link, see [[Importing - Basics#Assets - Importing <em>Assets</em>]].  The Import will add its <em>Asset</em> contents into the desired <em>Collection</em>.</p></div>
		

		<h2>Admin - Exporting All of <em>Concerto</em></h2>
		
		<div><h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>This action exports a copy of the entirety of <em>Concerto</em>'s data into a compressed archive.  The archive will contain all of the metadata in xml files, and all of the raw data (images, videos, audio) in separate files.  This archive is organized in such a way that the importer can import the data back into an instantiation of <em>Concerto</em> (theoretically in one fell swoop, but also easily in multiple pieces, for subsequent importers).</p>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>In 'Admin Tools' there is an 'Export' link for administrators to export all of <em>Concerto</em> for human readable backup of the system data.  Clicking this link will send you to a simple form that will execute the export for you.  All you need to do is fill in the form:</p>
		<p>The name for the resulting archive file should be entered into the text field (e.g. "backup-Dec-2005") and the compression chosen from the drop down menu provided.</p>
		<p>Once you have input an archive name, and chosen a compression you can click the button labeled 'Export'.  This will initiate the export and the export may take some time to complete.  You will notice your browser waiting for the page to load.  When the export is complete your browser will prompt you to save the archive or open it; some browsers will give you the option to rename the archive at this point, this is optional.  Choose to save the file to disk, and then find a location for the browser to save the archive.  This will download the archive to the location that you have chosen and is the final step to backing up <em>Concerto</em>.  When you are done and the process has completed, click the 'Cancel' button to be returned to 'Admin Tools'.</p>
		<h3>WARNING:</h3>
		<p>Please be aware that this archive may well be gargantuan, and is being made available as a human readable (XML) backup.  Decompressing the archive may take a lot of disk space and should be done only when necessary.</p>
		<p>Currently the only available compression is '.tar.gz' and the data that is being exported are the repositories only.</p>
		<h3>Export Format</h3>
		<p>The archive that is exported here will be ready for import by the Importer that is also available in 'Admin Tools'; however there is a significant chance that the importer will be unable to import the entire archive in one pass.  The archive is formatted so that each substantial subdivision of <em>Concerto</em> can be imported separately in case there is a need, see [[Importing - Advanced Topics#Admin - Importing All of Concerto]].</p>

------Concerto Installation-------

For the latest installation instructions and further security documentation, please
visit the Concerto Wiki:
	http://harmoni.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Concerto_Installation
	
----------------------------------

These instructions assume that you have downloaded the Concerto bundle
(which includes the Harmoni, Polyphony, and DOMIT libraries as well as the
Concerto viewer).

Dependencies:
    * Apache Webserver
    * PHP 5.2 or greater
    * One of the following databases:
          o MySQL 5.0 or greater
          o PostgreSQL 
    * The ImageMagick libraries - For thumbnail generation/image-resizing.
    * The following PEAR packages:
          o PEAR::DB - Needed by the OAI provider implementation.
          o PEAR::Archive_Tar - Needed for importing and exporting Assets.

Recommended Environment Settings:
	Concerto should run in a standard PHP environment, however due to the large
	ammount of processing needed in the manipulation of many large media files
	a variety of parameters probably need to be changed from their default values.
	
	PHP: (in php.ini or .htaccess files)
		- magic_quotes_gpc 		(Off)		(Must be set to Off)
		- post_max_size			(ex: 100M)	(should be larger than the largest media file)
		- upload_max_filesize 	(ex: 100M)	(should be larger than the largest media file)
		- max_execution_time	(ex: 6400)	(to allow for large/long import operations)
		- memory_limit 			(ex: 300M)	(should be larger than the largest media file)
	
	MySQL: (in my.cnf)
		- max_allowed_packet	(ex: 100M)	(should be larger than the largest media file)

	Apache: (in httpd.conf or similar)
		- Timeout				(ex: 6400)	(to allow for large/long import operations)
	
Setting up Concerto:
	1) Create a MySQL database for Concerto to use.
		A) create the database
		B) give a database user full permission to that database.

	2) Create your database config
		A) copy 
				concerto/config/database_default.conf.php
			to
				concerto/config/database.conf.php
	
		B) Modify your database config and change the database connection entry 
		   in the config to reflect the database that you just created.
	
	3) Create your Image Processor config
		A) copy 
				concerto/config/imageprocessor_default.conf.php
			to
				concerto/config/imageprocessor.conf.php
	
		B) Modify the 'imagemagick_path' property in theImage Processor config 
			to be the location in which ImageMagick is installed
		 
	4) (Optional) Set up LDAP authentication
		A) copy 
				concerto/config/authentication_default.conf.php
			to
				concerto/config/authentication.conf.php
		
		B) comment-in and modify the LDAP authentication piece in
				concerto/config/authentication.conf
			to fit your envirnment.
	
	5) Go to Concerto in your browser. The default administrator account is:
			Username: jadministrator
			Password: password
		Use the Concerto Admin tools to create a new admin account and delete
		the default one.
		
Troubleshooting:

	"MySQL server has gone away" Errors:
	If Concerto stores its files in a MySQL database, then the 
		max_allowed_packet
	option on the server needs to be raised above its default limit of 1MB.
	Note that Concerto base64 encodes file data to make it binary-safe, at the expense
	of a ~33% increase in storage size.
